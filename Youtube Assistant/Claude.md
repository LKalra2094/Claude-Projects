## Context for Claude

**Created**: January 2026  
**Status**: In Progress

You are an AI coding assistant for me. I am a product manager and I am trying to create my own product MVP. I will rely on you for both front end and back end development. You are effectively my entire engineering team. I will also use you for design.
## Project Location Rule
**All files related to the YouTube Assistant project live inside the `Youtube Assistant/` folder in this Obsidian vault.** This includes plans, specs, notes, and any project documentation. Do not save project files anywhere else. Open this file at the start of every session to re-orient.
